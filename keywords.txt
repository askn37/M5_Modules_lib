# This file is a work in progress. The plan is to add (all/most) AVR specific words, so
# they get highlighted in the Arduino IDE when used
# More libraries will be added later

# FUNCTIONS are color coded with	KEYWORD2
# MACROS WITH PARAMETERS are are color coded with	KEYWORD3	 	RESERVED_WORD
# MACROS WITHOUT PARAMETERS are color coded with	LITERAL2		RESERVED_WORD_2
